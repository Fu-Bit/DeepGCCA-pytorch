# DGCCA-pytorch:

A Pytorch Implementation of Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis as described in:

Adrian Benton, Huda Khayrallah, Biman Gujral, Dee Ann Reisinger, Sheng Zhang, and Raman Arora. Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis. The 4th Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP. 2019

DeepGCCA is a non-linear version of GCCA which uses neural networks as the feature extractor functions instead of linear transformers. DGCCA is some how exention of DeepCCA for more than two views though it has a different objective function.

# Prerequest:

- Python 3.6>=
- Pytorch 1.4 >= (should aslso work with >=1.0)
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Seanborn

# Other Implementations:

 - [Theano Implementation](https://bitbucket.org/adrianbenton/dgcca-py3/src/master/) By Adiran Benton.
 
 
 ## Notes:
 
 Warmest thanks to Mr. Adrian Benton for his kind helps.
